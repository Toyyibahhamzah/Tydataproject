									<h2><a href="#">DATA CLEANING IN SQL<br />
									</h2>
									<p> Data Cleaning is one of the most important aspect of a Data Science job and my SQL project is exactly 
										about that. This SQL project was more advanced and exciting than the previous one, 
										and I learned a lot about the process of data cleaning. 
										I downloaded the dataset of Housing in Nashville, TN from github and 
										simplified it by removing duplicates and unused columns, standardizing the data, 
										and splitting columns into multiple individual columns that are more usable. 
										I used statements such as CONVERT, ISNULL, PARSENAME, CASE, ROW_NUMBER, and PARTITION BY, 
										and also created CTE.You can check out my SQL Data Cleaning project through this link: <br />

										<h2><a href="#">EDUCATION FOR ALL FUNDRAISING</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images\Education for All.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In my role as a Data Analyst at Education for All, a charitable organization dedicated to universal education access, I utilized data analysis to enhance our fundraising strategy. 
										I delved into the donation and donor data to uncover actionable insights that would propel our fundraising efforts forward. My analysis revealed key trends in donor behavior. 
										Notably, while males contribute larger individual donations, females demonstrate a higher tendency for frequent donations. This insight suggests the need for targeted outreach strategies. 
										We can cultivate relationships for larger contributions from males, while fostering a culture of regular giving among females. Furthermore, the analysis identified specific job fields with higher donation frequency, such as Human Resources and Engineering. 
										This allows us to tailor our outreach and engagement efforts towards these high-potential industries. Geographical trends were also examined, revealing areas with higher and lower donation levels. 
										This information allows for a strategic allocation of resources, ensuring our fundraising efforts have the most significant impact. To increase donation frequency, we will target donors with established giving patterns like "Monthly" and "Often." 
										Additionally, we will identify and engage lapsed donors, aiming to understand and address the reasons behind their disengagement. Identifying high-value donors (those contributing over $200) proved insightful. 
										These generous individuals represent a significant portion of our total donations. We will leverage personalized stewardship efforts to cultivate their continued support and potentially increase their contribution levels. 
										Further analysis will explore traits that differentiate high donors from low donors, allowing us to develop targeted campaigns that nurture their support and potentially boost contributions. An intriguing finding involved the top cars driven by high-value donors. 
										This data allows us to tailor our outreach messages to resonate with their interests, potentially attracting similar donors and boosting overall contribution amounts. These data-driven insights form the foundation for a refined fundraising strategy. 
										By segmenting donors and understanding their behavior, we can optimize our approach to attract more donors, increase donation frequency, and ultimately maximize our impact in achieving universal education access.
										This project exemplifies the power of data analysis in informing and propelling strategic decision-making within the non-profit sector.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">EcoFurnish SALES ANALYSIS</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images\EcoFurnish.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> In addressing EcoFurnish's challenges, the initial step involved understanding the business context and the dataset structure. With a clear grasp of the company's eco-friendly furniture focus and the available data tables such as `dimproduct`, `dimcustomer`, and `factsales`, 
										I proceeded to formulate SQL queries to extract actionable insights. The SQL queries were meticulously crafted to delve into various facets of EcoFurnish's operations. Tasks ranged from basic inventory inquiries like listing available products and determining customer counts to more complex analyses 
										such as identifying loyal customers and recommending profitable product categories for a promotional campaign. Each query was tailored to extract specific information essential for understanding sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.
										The findings from the SQL queries provided valuable insights into EcoFurnish's business landscape. Key metrics such as total revenue, average sale amount per transaction, and inventory levels shed light on the company's financial health and operational efficiency. 
										By examining customer signup data, product pricing, and sales transaction details, I uncovered patterns that could inform strategic decision-making processes, particularly in inventory management, marketing strategies, and customer engagement initiatives.
										The analysis revealed several noteworthy findings. EcoFurnish boasts a diverse product inventory across different categories, indicating a broad market appeal. However, challenges such as low stock quantities for certain products and fluctuations in sales performance underscored the importance of robust inventory management practices and targeted marketing efforts. 
										Additionally, the identification of loyal customers and the recommendation of profitable product categories for promotional campaigns offer actionable insights to drive revenue growth and enhance customer loyalty.
										Based on the findings, several recommendations emerge. Strengthening inventory management processes to mitigate stockouts, targeting customers who signed up in specific periods with personalized marketing campaigns, and leveraging insights from loyal customer segments to tailor promotional efforts can all contribute to EcoFurnish's overall business success. 
										Furthermore, prioritizing product categories with high profitability for promotional campaigns can optimize marketing spend and maximize return on investment.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">LEWIS OFFICE STATIONERY AND DECORS</a></h2>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images\Lewis.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>I conducted a comprehensive analysis of Lewis's office supplies business, extracting and cleaning relevant data from the database before delving into SQL query writing for data manipulation and retrieval. 
										Utilizing my skills in applying conditional logic, I efficiently managed discounts and handled missing data to ensure accuracy. 
										Through rigorous analytical tasks, I identified key performance indicators such as revenue generation, order volume, and top-selling products, providing valuable insights into the business's performance over time. 
										This project showcases my proficiency in data analysis techniques, from data manipulation to trend identification, ultimately offering actionable insights for informed decision-making.</p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images\hotel.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project i cleaned and analyzed a hotel data. For this project
										 i aim to answer some business question <br>
										1. Is our hotel revenue growing by year? (Keeping in mind that we have two types of hotel) <br>
										2. Should we increase our parking lot size. <br>
										3. What customer type generate more revenue? <br>
										4 . What trends can we see in the data? <br>
										There are five tables in the data set.
										Firstly I extracted the data to SQL where I cleaned the data, applied CTE, UNION, LEFT JOIN statements, Numeric expressions to make the data more usable.
										Then I connected the SQL queries to power BI for visualization.</p>
