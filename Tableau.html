									<h2><a href="#">DATA CLEANING IN SQL<br />
									</h2>
									<p> Data Cleaning is one of the most important aspect of a Data Science job and my SQL project is exactly 
										about that. This SQL project was more advanced and exciting than the previous one, 
										and I learned a lot about the process of data cleaning. 
										I downloaded the dataset of Housing in Nashville, TN from github and 
										simplified it by removing duplicates and unused columns, standardizing the data, 
										and splitting columns into multiple individual columns that are more usable. 
										I used statements such as CONVERT, ISNULL, PARSENAME, CASE, ROW_NUMBER, and PARTITION BY, 
										and also created CTE.You can check out my SQL Data Cleaning project through this link: <br />

										<h2><a href="#">XpressTech Online Food Delivery <br />
											</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images\Xpresstech.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										XpressTech, a tech startup based in Lagos, Nigeria, transitioned from a ride-hailing company to logistics and food delivery services in 2020, following a ban on commercial motorcycles by the Government of Lagos State. 
										Leveraging existing resources and strategic partnerships, XpressTech swiftly adapted to the evolving market dynamics.
										As a Supply Chain Analyst, I undertook the task of analyzing customer preferences and behaviors to inform strategic decision-making within XpressTech. 
										Utilizing Tableau for data visualization and analysis, my objective was to derive actionable insights from the available dataset.
										Beginning with meticulous data cleaning, I processed the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability. Through calculated measures and segmentation techniques, I derived key performance indicators (KPIs) to gauge customer demographics and preferences. 
										These KPIs included insights such as the total number of customers surveyed (388), average family size (3), average age (25 years), gender distribution (166 females, 222 males).
										Carried out insight analysis on marital status distribution (69% single, 28% married, 3% undisclosed), occupation distribution (predominantly students and employees), income level distribution (majority falling under "No Income" category), and educational background (46% graduate, 45% post-graduate).
										Further analysis revealed dominant age group preferences (20-25 years), preferred ordering mediums (food delivery app for 92% of first orders, 54% for second orders), and popular meal types (snacks and lunch for first orders, dinner for second orders). 
										Additionally, customer satisfaction levels were high across various service aspects, including ease, convenience, time-saving, diverse restaurant choices, easy payment options, food quality, and package integrity.
										The analysis illuminated significant trends and areas for improvement within XpressTech's food delivery service. While the majority of customers expressed satisfaction with various service aspects, concerns regarding delays in delivery personnel assignment and food pickup were noted. 
										Additionally, customers emphasized the importance of attributes such as politeness, freshness, temperature, taste, and quantity of delivered items.
										To address these findings, I recommended that XpressTech should focus on optimizing delivery operations to reduce delays, enhancing tracking systems for real-time updates and transparency, diversifying restaurant partnerships to offer a wider variety of choices, 
										maintaining quality standards for food and packaging, implementing customer service training programs for delivery personnel, and actively soliciting and integrating customer feedback to refine and enhance service offerings.
										By implementing these recommendations, XpressTech can strengthen its position in the online food delivery market and foster lasting customer loyalty.

										<h2>INNOV8 EMPLOYEE ATTRITION ANALYSIS </h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images\Innov8 Attrition.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Innov8, a pioneering health technology company, faces a pressing challenge with increasing employee attrition rates. Despite its reputation as a trusted partner for health product retailers and hospital businesses, the rising attrition threatens its stability and productivity. 
										As a data analyst within Innov8, the task was clear: analyze the HR Attrition dataset and develop a dashboard to track essential attrition Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), aiming to inform effective retention strategies and foster a more engaged workforce.
										The journey began with uploading the dataset onto Tableau, followed by meticulous data cleaning and the generation of calculated measures. Through descriptive analysis, insightful patterns emerged. The company's workforce comprised 1,485 employees, with an attrition count of 243, resulting in a concerning attrition rate of 16%. 
										On average, employees were 37 years old, earned $6.53K, and had been with the company for seven years. Notably, attrition rates were highest among those aged 24 to 35, males constituted 64% of the attrition count, and employees in life sciences and medical fields experienced the highest attrition rates among educational backgrounds.										
										Further analysis highlighted departments facing significant attrition, notably Research & Development (R&D) and Sales, while HR experienced the least. Surprisingly, a positive correlation between travel frequency and attrition rate emerged, suggesting a need to review travel policies to balance work-life demands effectively.										
										To address these challenges, several recommendations were proposed. Firstly, targeted retention strategies should be developed, tailored to the specific needs of different age groups, with particular attention to the 24 to 35 demographic. Gender-inclusive policies must be evaluated and implemented to rectify any disparities contributing to attrition rates. 
										Professional development opportunities should be emphasized, especially within high-attrition departments like R&D and Sales, to enhance job satisfaction and career progression.					
										Moreover, a thorough review of travel policies is necessary to mitigate the negative impact of frequent travel on retention, potentially through alternative arrangements or incentives. Lastly, initiatives to boost employee engagement and collaboration across departments should be introduced, fostering a culture of satisfaction and reducing attrition.										
										By implementing these recommendations, Innov8 can address the root causes of attrition, ensuring a stable, engaged workforce poised for continued success in the competitive health technology sector.</p>

											<h2><a href="#">DEEPCARE HOSPITAL ER VISIT <br />
												</a></h2>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images\DCH.jpg" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											DeepCare Hospitals, led by Dr. John, the new Medical Director, aims to boost patient satisfaction and streamline ER operations. 
											Despite the hospital's commitment to swift care, Dr. John noticed a gap in ER performance. To address this, a data analysis was conducted to understand current ER dynamics and suggest improvements.
											Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as patient volume, average wait time, and satisfaction scores were examined. 
											Insights revealed opportunities for improvement, including the potential to reduce the 35-minute average wait time and optimize patient pathways within the ER.
											Additionally, seasonal trends in patient volume and demographic disparities were noted, prompting further investigation and a desire to benchmark against industry standards.
											Recommendations were formulated to address these findings, such as streamlining triage processes to reduce wait times and investigating reasons for underutilized department referrals.
											Implementing these recommendations could enhance ER efficiency and patient experience at DeepCare Hospitals.</p>
